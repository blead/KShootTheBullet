# Project Setup
1. Import the project
2. Add `.jar` files inside `/libraries` as libraries
3. After compiling the project, copy the contents of `/resources` into the compiler output directory. (If using _IntelliJ IDEA*_, the default directory name is `/out`.)

> _*IntelliJ IDEA can be downloaded from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/_
